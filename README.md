## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- `Node.js`
- `Express.js`
- `MongoDB`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KislayKashyap-hub/super-app.git


### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following installed:

- `Node.js`

- `npm (Node Package Manager)`

### Setting up MongoDB

 Install MongoDB on your machine.
